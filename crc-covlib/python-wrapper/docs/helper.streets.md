# streets helper module
Additional street related functionalities using OpenStreetMap data in support of crc-covlib.

This module aims at determining potential propagation paths for scenarios where antennas are below rooftops and the radio path is understood to occur mainly through street canyons. Typical usage is the obtention of input data for propagation models such as those found in ITU-R P.1411.

Typical workflow:
  1. GetStreetGraphFromBox() or GetStreetGraphFromPoints() to download OpenStreetMap data for the area of interest. This data may be visualized using DisplayStreetGraph().
  2. Use GetStreetCanyonsRadioPaths() to compute the shortest path(s) along street lines from the transmitter to the receiver stations. GetStreetCanyonsRadioPaths() returns one or more StreetCanyonsRadioPath objects. ExportRadioPathToGeojsonFile() may be used to visualize those path objects from a GIS software.
  3. Optionally, computed StreetCanyonsRadioPath objects may be further simplified (i.e. that is, to reduce the number of vertices in the path) using SimplifyRadioPath() or SortRadioPathsByStreetCornerCount().
  4. The DistancesToStreetCorners(), StreetCornerAngles() and ReceiverStreetOrientation() functions, as well as attributes from the StreetCanyonsRadioPath objects (distances_m, turnAngles_deg, etc.) may be used for input parameters to propagation models (ITU-R P.1411 for instance).

from crc_covlib.helper import streets

### StreetGraph
#### crc_covlib.helper.streets.StreetGraph

### StreetCanyonsRadioPath
#### crc_covlib.helper.streets.StreetCanyonsRadioPath
```python
class StreetCanyonsRadioPath()
```
Data class for storing details about a propagation path occuring through street canyons (i.e. propagation along street lines). One ore more instance(s) may be obtained from GetStreetCanyonsRadioPaths().

Attributes:
- __latLonPath__ (list[tuple[float, float]]): List of n (latitude, longitude) tuples constituting the vertices for the propagation path along street segments, from transmitter to receiver (degrees, EPSG:4326).
- __turnAngles_deg__ (list[float]): List of n-2 turn angles between street segments in latLonPath (degrees). The first angle is at latLonPath[1] and the last angle is at latLonPath[-2]. Angle values are from 0 (going straight forward) to 180 (u-turn). Note that turn angles are always positive so there is no differentiation between right-hand and left-hand turns at the same angle.
- __isIntersection__ (list[bool]): List of n-2 boolean values indicating whether points between street segments in latLonPath are street intersections. The first boolean value is at latLonPath[1] and the last one is at latLonPath[-2].
- __distances_m__ (list[float]): List of n-1 street segment distances (meters) in latLonPath. The first value is the distance between latLonPath[0] and latLonPath[1], the last value is the distance between latLonPath[-2] and latLonPath[-1].
- __txLatLon__ (tuple[float, float]): Transmitter's location as a (latitude, longitude) tuple (degrees, EPSG:4326). latLonPath[0] is the closest point from txLatLon that is located on a street segment.
- __rxLatLon__ (tuple[float, float]): Receiver's location as a (latitude, longitude) tuple (degrees, EPSG:4326). latLonPath[-1] is the closest point from rxLatLon that is located on a street segment.
