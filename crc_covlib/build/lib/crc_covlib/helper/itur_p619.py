    ITU-R P.619-5, Attachment F to Annex 1
    Provides a simple test which estimates the power received due to rain scattering in a common
    volume between two cylindrical antenna beams for a rain rate of Rrain mm/hr. The test estimates
    the unwanted rain-scattered power received by the victim receiver exceeded for a given 
    percentage time p.
    
    Args:
        r1 (float): Radius of cylinder representing the first antenna beam, in meters, with r1 <= r2.
        r2 (float): Radius of cylinder representing the second antenna beam, in meters, with r1 <= r2.
        unwanted_cyl (int): Cylinder representing the unwanted beam. Should be set to either 1 or 2.
        scatter_angle_deg (float): The angle between the direction of propagation of the incoming
            power in one cylinder and the scattered power travelling towards the victim receiver.
            The test is considered reliable for 10 <= scatter_angle_deg <= 90 degrees.
        Rrain (float): Point rainfall rate in mm/h for a 1 minute integration time exceeded for p% time.
        f_GHz (float): Frequency in GHz.
        Peirp (float): E.i.r.p. of the unwanted transmitter in dBW.
        d_tx (float): Distance from the unwanted transmitter to the common volume in km.
        d_rx (float): Distance in km of the interfered-with antenna from the common volume represented
            by the cylinders.
        el_deg (float): The path elevation angle, in degrees.
        tau_deg (float): The polarization tilt angle relative to the horizontal (tau = 45 deg for
            circular polarization).
        P_hPa (float): Atmospheric pressure, in hPa.
        rho_gm3 (float): Water vapour density, in g/m3.
        T_K (float): Temperature, in Kelvins.

    Returns:
        Ptxs (float): An estimate of the unwanted scattered power, in dBW. A full rain-scatter
        calculation should be conducted if Pint - Ptxs < 20 dB, where Pint is the receiver's
        interference threshold.
